As an authorized Microsoft partner, Microsoft Office 365 offers you an opportunity to grow your customer base and create lasting relationships with them. For a monthly or annual fee paid to you, your customers can use cloud-based services so they don't have to manage data backups, server hardware, and server updates. The services available to you depend on the types of services you are authorized to provide.
  
> [!NOTE]

To receive access to the partner features, you can join Cloud Essentials by signing the [Microsoft Online Services Partner Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=285473). 
  
## <a name="create-trial-invitations-and-purchase-orders"></a>Creazione di inviti e ordini di acquisto di prova

You can create and send trial invitations to your customers so they can try Office 365 by using the **Partner overview** page in Office 365. The invitation can contain one or more services, depending on the offer. If you're certified to offer delegated administration, you can add an option to the trial invitation that allows you to administer the account on behalf of your customer. This makes it easier for your customer to try Office 365. 
  
After you've sent a trial invitation for Office 365 to a customer, you can follow up by creating and sending a purchase offer that's customized to fit the needs of your customer including the specific services and the number of licenses your customer needs. If you're certified to offer delegated administration, you can add the option to the purchase offer that allows you to administer the account on behalf of your customer.
  
## <a name="provide-delegated-administration"></a>Amministrazione delegata

Delegated administration allows a partner to have full administrative access to all the customer's services and subscriptions. This means you can perform administrative tasks on behalf of customers (including setting up mailboxes, adding or removing users and groups, data migration, and submitting service requests to Microsoft Customer Service and Support). Delegated administration capability is offered exclusively for partners who are enrolled in Cloud Essentials, Cloud Accelerate or the Cloud Deployment programs.
  
Before you can start administering a customer's account, the customer must authorize you as a delegated administrator. To get customer approval, you send them an offer for delegated administration, which you can include with a trial invitation or purchase offer. The customer authorizes a Delegated Administration partner by responding to the partner's invitational email.
  
Ogni cliente ha il diritto di avere un partner di amministrazione delegata. Il partner può anche essere un partner di record del cliente, ma non è obbligatorio. I ruoli di partner di record e amministrazione delegata sono separati e il cliente li assegna separatamente. Questo approccio consente al cliente di scegliere un partner per la consulenza sugli acquisti e un altro partner per l'implementazione o i servizi gestiti. Ciò consente anche ai partner di scegliere se specializzarsi in particolare in uno dei due ruoli o se svolgerli entrambi.
  
Anche quando un cliente ha autorizzato un partner per lo svolgimento delle attività di amministrazione per suo conto, mantiene comunque il diritto di rivolgersi direttamente al supporto tecnico Microsoft e inviare richieste di servizio.
